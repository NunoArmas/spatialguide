			  We store all the important information (points of interest, user information, routes in a Database. The communication between a smartphone and the database is done through a web app with a rest API. <br>
				The application will run on a smartphone with Android and GPS. The application will also be able to read data from a IMU sensor. That app will have an auralization engine that given a mono sound file will convert it to a stereo sound. For the best experience we recommend headphones with noise cancellation.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              We gathered some user stories from people who are in the Tourism area (the scope of this app), so we at the 
              development stage are pretty sure and focused on what the app should have in order to complete user's requirements.

              Jessica is an architecture grad student that is very interested in historical landmarks and modern art. 
              When she has some free time from classes she likes to travel and get in touch with new cultures. 
              As a born explorer, so it is very important for her to get the most out of the places she visits and so, 
              she frequently uses web advisors in order to get information on these new places. However, one of the things 
              that she finds utmost annoying is the fact that most of these web advisors require her to often look at her smartphone, 
              making it very difficult for her to get an absolute immersive experience. So, she began using SpacialGuide app. 
              This tool has hallowed her to fully enjoy the experience, as it works as a voice guide that tours the visitors on 
              the landmarks history and highlights. One of her favorite things about this app is the audio specialization feature 
              that lets her contemplate the landmarks, at the time she gets information on it. <br><br>
              On her most recent trip to New York, Jessica decided to try a ride on a tourist bus, as it’s an easy and comfortable 
              way to get to know a big town like this.  However, due to the sound pollution, it was very difficult for her to 
              understand what the tourist guide was saying. So Jessica decided to use the SpacialGuide app. In fact, it was by 
              far easier for her to ignore the surrounding sounds and focus on the landmarks.

              Steve, a 50 year-old tourist guide, is the older person working on his company. His vast experience makes 
              him one of the most required members of the company. Steve’s work ethics focus on guarantying his clients 
              have the best experience possible. Despite counting on his colleague’s help, Steve is a known “old school” 
              tourist guide, and so, he sometimes gets frustrated when dealing with new technologies. Recently his company 
              began looking for a tool that could help to give a better experience to the clients, without presenting itself 
              as a tech-challenge. So, Steve and his colleagues began to use the SpaceGuide app. The simplicity of this tool 
              easily allows them to insert new routes, as well as audio files that inform the tourist on the history and 
              highlights of the landmarks. Ever since, Steve has become increasingly familiar with the software and is now 
              able to fully understand his clients ultimate goal, as well as to easily provide them the best experience they 
              could have.
