			<h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">
        Welcome to the Dev Notes section of our website!<br>
        Here we will be explaining the development challenges and decisions we made under the development stages of our system.<br><br>
        <b>NOTE: </b>This section is going to suffer multiple updates as soon as we add more features or development decisions.<br><br>
        
        At first glance of the system, we needed to gather opinion about what technologies to choose, and what primary decisions about the
        system architecture and steps to do further upon development. So, we asked multiple teachers from our department to help us go to the correct
        path.<br><br>
        Diogo Gomes and João Paulo Barraca were the teachers which prontly answered to us and with them, we got multiple ideas and possible features to be
        added. One of the main difficulties we found was the technology choice (which languages, which database, which platform we could choose were some of the
        questions asked). We would like to publicly thank them for the help provided, which got us on the right track for the begin of development.<br><br>

        After some team meetings with Guilherme Campos, we got the theory behind spatial audio and the main feature of the app explained, and we were ready to start
        developing the whole system.<br>
        Today, we have weekly meetings to keep track of current development and for having feedback of it.
        <br><br>
      </p>
			<h3 id="arch">System Architecture</h3>
			  <br><br>
				<img src="img/systemArch.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" >
			  <br><br>
			  <p style="text-align: justify;">
        As SpatialGuide system main use is deployed in a smartphone, we needed to know if we could go to a cross-platform way (React Native / Cordova / Ionic for instance),
        or a native way (Android). Because of the connection with the IMU Sensor (to gather head position), and the suggested use of a audio library (first glance 
        of spatial audio build) we needed to go to that path instead of having a web-based app. Here the decision was to build a native app with Android, which also 
        eases the development as all team has Java language knowledge.<br><br>
        
        Then we needed to know what technologies we should choose for the backend and which database to choose to store the data (points of interest, user information, routes, etc). 
        As some of the team members have already experience in Django and MySQL, we turned that way to build a traditional backend-frontend system, 
        which will communicate with the Android app via a REST API.<br><br>

        So, SpatialGuide will consist on a Android app supported by a web app that will store and send the data to be used in the app. The app runs on a Android 
        smartphone, and should have GPS sensor and Bluetooth, as well as to be capable of connecting stereo headphones via jack port.<br><br>

        The app will have an auralization engine that given a sound file will compute spatial sound (3D Audio) according to the users position. 
        For best audio experience we recommend the use of stereo headphones with noise cancellation.
        </p>
        <br><br>

      <h3 id="userstories">User Stories</h3>
      <br>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        We gathered some user stories from people who are in the Tourism area (the scope of this app), so we at the 
        development stage are pretty sure and focused on what the app should have in order to complete user's requirements.
        <br><br>
			  <img src="img/Jessica.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" >
			  <br><br>
              Jessica is an architecture grad student that is very interested in historical landmarks and modern art. 
              When she has some free time from classes she likes to travel and get in touch with new cultures. 
              As a born explorer, so it is very important for her to get the most out of the places she visits and so, 
              she frequently uses web advisors in order to get information on these new places. However, one of the things 
              that she finds utmost annoying is the fact that most of these web advisors require her to often look at her smartphone, 
              making it very difficult for her to get an absolute immersive experience. So, she began using SpacialGuide app. 
              This tool has hallowed her to fully enjoy the experience, as it works as a voice guide that tours the visitors on 
              the landmarks history and highlights. One of her favorite things about this app is the audio specialization feature 
              that lets her contemplate the landmarks, at the time she gets information on it. <br><br>
              On her most recent trip to New York, Jessica decided to try a ride on a tourist bus, as it’s an easy and comfortable 
              way to get to know a big town like this.  However, due to the sound pollution, it was very difficult for her to 
              understand what the tourist guide was saying. So Jessica decided to use the SpacialGuide app. In fact, it was by 
              far easier for her to ignore the surrounding sounds and focus on the landmarks.
              <br><br>
              <img src="img/Steve.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" >
			  <br><br>
              Steve, a 50 year-old tourist guide, is the older person working on his company. His vast experience makes 
              him one of the most required members of the company. Steve’s work ethics focus on guarantying his clients 
              have the best experience possible. Despite counting on his colleague’s help, Steve is a known “old school” 
              tourist guide, and so, he sometimes gets frustrated when dealing with new technologies. Recently his company 
              began looking for a tool that could help to give a better experience to the clients, without presenting itself 
              as a tech-challenge. So, Steve and his colleagues began to use the SpaceGuide app. The simplicity of this tool 
              easily allows them to insert new routes, as well as audio files that inform the tourist on the history and 
              highlights of the landmarks. Ever since, Steve has become increasingly familiar with the software and is now 
              able to fully understand his clients ultimate goal, as well as to easily provide them the best experience they 
              could have.

              Paul is one of the Administrators of SpatialGuide. His job is to make sure every user (tourist and guide) gets the best out of SpatialGuide.
              For that he needs to manage all the routes and user information so that everything goes right when the app is used.
              Paul is very good at what he does and is always on the lookout for new ways of perfecting his job and making it more efficient, since he loves the company and their ideas and,
              therefore he wants them to grow and be very successfull.

          </p>

      <h3 id="appfunctioning">App development</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        As one of the main uses of the system is the Android app, it should have the basic user creation / access, to let users use the app and the system, 
        so they can make track of the routes and points, and use the system anywhere.<br><br>

        After the successful sign in, the user should then choose the route which will navigate on, which data is downloaded and stored on the internal device storage and then used
        upon selection. The route data is fetched via our system REST API. To handle REST requests, it's used the library <a href="http://square.github.io/retrofit/" target="_blank">Retrofit</a>
        for a safe, easy and async request onto our API. The REST API provides the information we need about routes, points of interest, among many other useful related information to the general app usage. 
        The images URL fetched on the REST API is then injected on Android's ImageView using <a href="http://square.github.io/picasso/" target="_blank">Picasso</a>, which downloads and caches the image in a easy 
        and straight-forward way.<br><br>
      
        After the route selection, the user will enter in the route map screen, which will track the user current location with GPS, and with the markers of the route points of interest,
        as well as the directions to the points of interest, fetched with <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/">Google Directions API</a>. 
        We also offer the possibility of the user changing the order of the points to visit, by using drag and drop in the selection menu, and the user can also select one of two modes for it: 
        "Shortest Path", which will take on the shortest route between the points selected, and "Adventure Mode", which will randomize the order of the point visit. 
        The map will show the recommended direction based on the order of the points selected or the mode selected.<br><br>

        When the user location approaches the point of interest, a popup window will appear with the point information, and the app will start playing the sound spatialized of that point,
        according to the user head position.
      </p>
      <br><br>

      <h3 id="headposition">Getting the head position</h3>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">
        Initially, the goal was to fetch the head position (yaw, pitch, roll) of the user using a IMU Sensor (the equipment provided to us were InertiaCube BT).
        However, as the device's SDK and Bluetooth had issues on how to get the coordinates, and spend lots of time trying to fix the problem, we switched to another way to 
        get the user head position, with simply using another smartphone to provide the users head position with the gyroscope sensor of the smartphone.<br><br>
        
        That way, we can easily attach a smartphone to the headphones to test this approach, and use Bluetooth to communicate with both devices (SpatialGuide app and head position app).
        For now, it's a easy solution to our problem, given the deadline. For this communication to work, we need to develop another app for the "sensor smartphone", being able to communicating both ways.
        Then we can provide the user position to the auralization engine to then compute the spatial audio according to the user position and the position related to the point of interest.
      </p>
      <br><br>

			<h3 id="nextWork">What is next?</h3>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">
        <br>- Auralization Engine development and usage within the app;
        <br>- Pairing with another smartphone that will be used as head-tracking sensor;
        <br>- Add more features overall.
      </p>
      <br><br>
